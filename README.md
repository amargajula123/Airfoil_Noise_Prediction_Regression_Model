# Airfoil_Noise_Prediction_Regression_Model
Predicts sound pressure level (SPL) from airfoil data using regression models. Uses features like frequency, angle of attack, chord length, and velocity to estimate acoustic noise, helping design quieter, more efficient systems in aviation and wind energy.



"Python 3.9.19 — from this version, I am going to install libraries which are supported,"

it means:

You have chosen Python 3.9.19 as your project’s Python version.

You will install only those libraries that are compatible and work well with Python 3.9.19.

This helps avoid version conflicts or errors that happen if a library requires a different Python version.

It ensures your environment (local or deployed) is stable and predictable because both Python and library versions are compatible.
