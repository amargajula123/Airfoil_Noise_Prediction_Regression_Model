# Airfoil_Noise_Prediction_Regression_Model
Predicts sound pressure level (SPL) from airfoil data using regression models. Uses features like frequency, angle of attack, chord length, and velocity to estimate acoustic noise, helping design quieter, more efficient systems in aviation and wind energy.
